- This is a 'fork' of the Jira Work Log Report Chrome extension. 
- Modified to support current Calendar Quarter reporting.
- The change adds the Quarter option in the timeframe dropdown and also displays the total in hours instead of days, hours minutes only.

## Installation
To add to chrome:
- go to Extensions, make sure Developer Mode is enabled
- Load Unpacked and choose the root dir of this repo
- Invoke the extension and add your Jira url
- NO NEED TO ADD CREDS - the extension will use the cookie, so you need to be authenticated to Jira
